# roblox-scripts
Here I put my scripts.

My Scripts that I made are not 100% mine [Someone else might be using the same code] so I use the Unlicensed License to make it open source


About: This is an Open-Source project for people who cannot find some scripts for their game, or wawnt an inspiration!

If you would like to help with donating your own scripts, send a message to hernikplays on ROBLOX!
